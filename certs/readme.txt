Hi,

thanks for using this website to generate a SSL certficiate for your XAMPP (or any other) development platform.

Add the ca.ssl.indexnl.com.crt CA certificate to your Trusted Authorities Store (if you not already done that), instructions for Windows and Android are on the website.

This is how you add the certificate https://ssl.indexnl.com/xampp-wamp-ssl/

You can also generate a real wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate, valid for 3 months on https://wildcard.indexnl.com/

If you have questions don't hesitate to ask them on the forum of Apache Friends : https://community.apachefriends.org/f/

Happy Coding!

Tony.
