NOTE: This repository is no longer actively maintained. Since it was only ever supposed to serve as a prototype, only testnet bitcoins can be used (as opposed to mainnet coins). This software will not function unless you have a full bitcoin node running and have made the necessary changes in this repository's source code to reflect that.
